# Pterodactyl Panel Eggs

Free Eggs made for the Pterodactyl Panel for anyone to use!  

Full list of Docker Images available at my [Quay](https://quay.io/repository/yajtpg/pterodactyl-images?tab=tags)  

Module Error? Any global package missing? Feel free to open an issue and I'll try my best to fix it/help you.  
You can also open an Issue if you'd like to suggest an egg or something.  
I'd suggest you to keep in mind that the average size of a Docker image is ~500MB and can sometimes even go upto 2GB.  
Currently, I only supply `linux/amd64` versions.  
Thanks for checking out my Pterodactyl Eggs!  
p.s; If I removed a version from the list of images and you still need them, you can manually add them by getting the pull tag from Quay. (I don't delete any previous images)
